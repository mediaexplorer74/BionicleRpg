## About 
" BIONICLE: Destiny of the Toa is a 2D top-down RPG with procedurally generated islands and dungeons. Experience the infinite possibilities when it comes to world exploration, start a new game, and get a new world every time, or save the game to reload and explore your absolute favorite world again and again.

Use mask powers to find new ways to explore the world around you. Visit all the different biomes, either by yourself or use the map if you ever get lost.

Help the Matoran villagers by accepting quests. Venture out into the world to gather materials, clear dungeons or defeat enemies." 

## My 2 cents
- Pathfinder repaired via AI in MS Copilot (thanks to VS 2022 Preview))
- Player movements fixed
- Near weapon (left button click) activated
- Semi-god mode explored (I detected player's death not realized by original dev team, hehe)
- Screen scaling is ok for now 

## Controls
- WASD: Move
- LMB: Normal attack
- RMB: Elemental attack
- Left Shift: Mask power
- 1-6: Change character / mask (idk yet whats up... find the names of mask modes in src code)))
- M: Map (Up key- increase map scale, Down key - decrease scale)
- F: Interact
